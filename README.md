# Cybersecurity Incident Triage Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidentsâ€”categorizing them as True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP). By leveraging historical evidence and customer responses from the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, the model will enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by automating the triage process, providing SOC analysts with accurate, context-rich recommendations.
